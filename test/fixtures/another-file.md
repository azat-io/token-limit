# Another Test File

This is another test file used for testing multiple file patterns.

## Purpose

This file helps verify that:

- Multiple glob patterns work correctly
- File deduplication functions properly
- Different files can be processed together

## Content

Some additional content to make this file different from the first one.
This ensures we can distinguish between files in tests.
